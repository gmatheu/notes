# What

The goal of this article is to explore some more flexible (\*) alternatives to screensharing (usually during meetings)

\*): More flexible than the defaults methods provided by any browser integration (Application window, browser tab or Desktop Window)

# Why

I usually work with a secondary monitor, and I want to share my screen with others, the way to go is just to screenshare that monitor.
(of course, in the cases that I want to share jumping from multiple applications).

But, the challenge arises when the secondary monitor is not available or I am sharing a presentation (in presentation mode... that usually is like a full screen) ...
and I don't want to share my main screen.

I explored some alternatives to achieve a richer sharing experience

# How

These are some alternative approaches:

- Virtual Monitor on the same X server

- Virtual X Server (e.g: Xvfb)

- Compose using OBS
